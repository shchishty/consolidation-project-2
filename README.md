# Tuple Out Dice Game for Consolidation Project 2

This project is a game in which you can roll dice amongst multiple players. The goal is to get the most points. The rules for this game are down below:

## Rules

- This game may have one or more players.
- The object of the game is to score the most points, or to be the first to reach a certain score.
- Players take turns rolling dice to score points, as described below.
- Each turn, the active player rolls three dice:
    - If all three dice are rolled with the same number, the player has “tupled out”, and ends their turn with zero points. (For example, rolling three “4”s at the same time.)
    - If two dice have the same value, they are “fixed”, and they cannot be re-rolled.
    - The player can re-roll any dice that are not “fixed”, as often as they would like until they decide to stop, or until they “tuple out” (get three of the same number).
- When a player decides to stop, they score points equal to the total of the three dice, and then their turn ends.
- If a player “tuples out”, their turn ends and they score 0 points for that turn.
